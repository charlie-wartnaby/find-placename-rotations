# find-placename-rotations
Find placenames that are identical when rotated by some number of letters

This answers the question of whether there are British placenames that,
like Kyoto and Tokyo, are rotations of each other -- i.e. you can chop the
end of one name off, stick it on the beginning, and find you have the same
name as some other place.

It depends on first downloading the dataset mentioned in comments and
extracting the .csv file, for which the filename and column name are
referenced in variables. Obviously you can modify this to process some list of
your own.
